# Laptop_Price_Predictor
This Project is based on Machine Learning.
We have used Python Libraries also .
This project will tell us about the approximate price of the laptop.

We will use streamlit to create a web app to predict laptop prices.
In a web application, we need to implement a form that takes all the inputs from users that we have used in a dataset, and by using the dumped model we predict the output and display it to a user.
Streamlit is an open-source web framework written in Python. It is the fastest way to create data apps and it is widely used by data science practitioners to deploy machine learning models.

### Here's the Snapshot ->

### About the Project
* We will make a project for Laptop price prediction. The problem statement is that if any user wants to buy a laptop then our application should be compatible to provide a tentative price of laptop according to the user configurations.
* Although it looks like a simple project or just developing a model, the dataset we have is noisy and needs lots of feature engineering, and preprocessing that will drive your interest in developing this project.
* We will use streamlit to create a web app to predict laptop prices.
In a web application, we need to implement a form that takes all the inputs from users that we have used in a dataset, and by using the dumped model we predict the output and display it to a user.
* Streamlit is an open-source web framework written in Python. It is the fastest way to create data apps and it is widely used by data science practitioners to deploy machine learning models.
